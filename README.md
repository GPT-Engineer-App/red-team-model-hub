# red-team-model-hub

I want to create an app to red-team large language models. The users should be able to
- Create and store prompts to attack the model
- Setup a connection to a model via API endpoint
- Execute the prompt and get responses from the model
- Able to rate the response from 1-5
- Have a dashboard with statistics about the rated responses.
